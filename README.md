# Josef Aljasmi

Hi my name is Josef, and I am currently a student in ITHS. I'm a very passionate and dedicated person to learning a lot about programming and AI development. Previously I have been through an App development course and studied a lot of game development on my own creating some small projects here and there. Even before that I went to the IB course studying a bit of python in my spare time. After a lot of testing different variations of programming I had the biggest interest in AI development hence where I am now
